# Data-Science-on-HMEQ_Loss-with-R

File name: **Box plot.R**
This R script preprocesses the HMEQ_Loss dataset through systematic data cleaning and preparation. It begins with exploratory steps like examining structure, summary statistics, and sample rows, followed by visualizations using **boxplots **and **histograms **to analyze variability and distributions. Missing values in numeric columns are imputed using medians or logical replacements, with imputed values stored in new columns prefixed with IMP_ and indicators for missingness prefixed with M_. Original columns are dropped post-imputation. The categorical REASON column is one-hot encoded into binary flags (FLAG.R.HomeImp and FLAG.R.DebtCon), and the original column is removed. These steps ensure missing data and categorical variables are effectively handled, creating a clean, analysis-ready dataset.
